            <h2>Clubs and Societies</h2>
            <p>We have a wide range of clubs and societies catering to different interests including music, dance, photography, and more. Students can join these clubs to explore their passions and meet like-minded individuals.</p>
            <br>
            <p><h2 style="text-align: center;">Clubs</h2>
                <h3>Music Club</h3>
               "Music speaks what cannot be expressed, 
               soothes the mind and gives it rest, 
               heals the heart and makes it whole,
               Flows from the heavens, into the soul."
               <br>
               Well described by the quoted lines, we the Department of Management Studies present to you the music society of the Department – ‘Rang’. Rang means colour and our objective, here at Rang, is to bring together the different shades of music, much like a painter who brings out the most beautiful of pictures, from his humble palette. We believe that it is when all the ‘colours’, kinds and genres of music come together, that we have a beautiful melody and an orchestra to play it.
               <br>
               We, at Rang perform for the love of music – as an art, a passion, a joy and most importantly, a way of life – while representing our Department in various competitions remains the chief means to this end. At the end of the day, to us, the laurels we bring home are not just the prizes or accolades we gather; they lie in the smiles on the faces of those we perform for and that, is the ultimate goal we strive to achieve.
               <br>
                <h3>Dance Club</h3>
               “To dance is to be out of yourself. Larger, more beautiful, more powerful...
               This is power, it is glory on earth and it is yours for the taking”
               <br>
               The Department of Management Studies has always encouraged the learning and imparting of various art forms. The Dance Club is a new initiative taken by the Department to bring out the hidden talents of students and help them explore themselves. This club is a separate wing of the Christ University Management Association (CUMA) exclusively designed to improve the quality of dance and cultural activities in the Department.
               The Dance Club aims at giving various opportunities to all the students in the Department to showcase their skills and to unearth their potential. The various events proposed by the club are primarily aimed at providing ample exposure to the students for facing competitions within and outside college. In order to bring out the best from the students, the Department plans to organize an Art Festival where the students can showcase their talent through Solo performances, Group Performances, Classical Performances etc. Few of the other initiatives taken by the club to propagate dance are Face-Offs, Flash Mobs and The Battle of Dances.
               The Dance Club targets to make use of every opportunity to enhance the level of dance and inculcate dance forms which have never been introduced. Thus, it does suffice to say that it is the joy in our feet that drives us, to put our best foot forward, every time at the Dance Club of the Department of Management Studies, Christ University, Bangalore.

               <h3>Writers club</h3>
               The Writers’ Club is a literary society within the Department of Management Studies, Christ University. Founded by Pruthvish Kumar J. in 2014, with the objective of propagating the spirit of literature and reintroducing the culture of writing in the youth of today, it tasted success in its very first year, with the release of the book “The Pen and The Sword: The Book of The People”.
               What distinguishes the Writers’ Club from other literary societies, is the fact that it isn’t just for those who are already acquainted with the art of writing, but is also open to those who would like to toe the line that separates the fantastical from the mundane, and see if it is to their liking. In other words, the Writers’ Club is a platform of sorts, for both- those who write, and those who wish to write. Indeed, most of the Club’s sessions focus on the writing process itself, putting its members through the paces (literally), and working on improving their language, grammar, style, and technique, while also helping tap into any latent creativity, and stirring it to life.
               For it is said that “It is better to have a heart without words, than words without a heart”, here at the Writers’ Club, we welcome all those who love writing – be it the actual process of creative writing, or simply the joy of expressing what one feels, through the elite art of stringing the right words together for the purpose of celebrating a shared passion for the English Language.</p>
